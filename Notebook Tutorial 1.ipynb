    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we're going to show you how to use `pandas`, `altair`, and `datapane` to build a dashboard\n",
    "of COVID vaccinations. Follow along with the code snippets here. Alternatively, you can find the full code on\n",
    "the \"Source code\" page of this report.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Analyzing our data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will fetch the vaccination data from\n",
    "OurWorldInData and will use Datapane to create a report with visualizations and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the libraries and download our dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import altair as alt\n",
    "import datapane as dp\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have our dataset, we can take a look to see which we can plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "{{}}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to compare a few countries in our Datapane report, what do we have to choose from?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find the unique locations using `df['location'].unique()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "{{}}\n",
    "\n",
    "We will pick a few we're interested in and filter the dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "countries = ['United Kingdom', 'Germany', 'France']\n",
    "\n",
    "subset = df[df.location.isin(countries)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "{{}}\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is now a more manageable size for visualizing in our report. \n",
    "For our visualization, let's create a plot for `total_vaccinations_per_hundred`, `daily_vaccinations_per_million`, and `people_vaccinated`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating our visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "A great thing about Altair is that we can create a common base which we reuse across the multiple plots in our report.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following Python code, we're setting a bit of stroke and adjusting the opacity to make our report a bit more visually appealing. \n",
    "We're also choosing to make it interactive, so our users can zoom in and out. Datapane will make the plots responsive for us automatically when we create our report.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "base = alt.Chart(df).encode(\n",
    "    x='date:T',\n",
    "    color='location'\n",
    ").mark_area(\n",
    "    opacity=0.5, \n",
    "    stroke='black'\n",
    ").interactive()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have our base, we only need to choose the y axis for each (remember, we can put the x axis in our base, because every plot uses date.)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c1 = base.encode(y='total_vaccinations_per_hundred')\n",
    "c2 = base.encode(y='daily_vaccinations_per_million')\n",
    "c3 = base.encode(y='people_vaccinated')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's preview what these plots look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "{{}}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating our report\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have some plots and a DataFrame, we can build our report using datapane. \n",
    "Datapane provides components which wrap around the different plots and datasets inside our notebook, \n",
    "such as `DataTable` and `Plot`. We're also using the `Group` component, which allows us to place components in a column or grid layout. \n",
    "`DataTable` and `Plot` both have an optional caption parameter where we can provide some further info.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "report = dp.Report(\n",
    "  dp.DataTable(df, caption=f'Dataset for {countries}'),\n",
    "  dp.Group(dp.Plot(c1, caption='Vaccination %'), dp.Plot(c2, caption='Daily vaccinations per million'), columns=2),\n",
    "  dp.Plot(c3, caption='Total vaccinations')\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To review your report before sharing, you can save it as an HTML file using `report.save(path='vaccinations.html', open=True)`, or view it on the other page of this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing our report\n",
    "\n",
    "When we're happy with our report, we can publish it to Datapane.com so we can share it online and get feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't already, make sure you've logged into your Datapane API with your token before publishing (you can find your token in your [settings](https://datapane.com/settings)\n",
